### What I learned

This project was definetly a challenge, with recently having had learned about React I decided to incorporate that within this project. In previous projects I had mostly focused using components. However in this project I made use of props as well as usestate. I'm nowhere near becoming a react expert as of now, but I must say it did teach me alot on how where and when to make best use out of it.

css -
  I still fins pseudo selectors to be a pain so hopefully I used them properly here.

js -
 The useState and passing down functions and values as props, proud moment there. 

### Continued development

Just as mentioned above I am still relatively new to React the when and how to implement useState is confusing. I aim to make more use of it in efforts to better understand it. Another thing mentioned above pseudo selectors, I might just have take on a made up project just to really understand it better.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/.com) - Shout out to React course on Scrimba, definetly taught me more than I had been able to grasp in my previous self taught methods.
